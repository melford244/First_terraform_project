Hereâ€™s a **proper title** for your Terraform-based EC2 instance deployment project:

---

### **Title:**
**"Automated EC2 Instance Deployment on AWS Using Terraform: A Step-by-Step Guide"**

---

### **Why This Title Works:**
1. **Automated:** Highlights the use of Terraform for automation.
2. **EC2 Instance Deployment:** Clearly states the primary objective of the project.
3. **AWS:** Specifies the cloud platform being used.
4. **Using Terraform:** Emphasizes the tool (Terraform) used for infrastructure as code (IaC).
5. **Step-by-Step Guide:** Indicates that the project includes detailed instructions for implementation.
